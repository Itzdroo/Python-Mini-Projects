ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Scikit-learn (sklearn)
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for data visualization)

ðŸš€ Features
Text preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization)
Vectorization using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
Sentiment Classification using Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / any ML model
Accuracy score and confusion matrix
Can be trained on any small labeled dataset (like movie reviews, tweets, etc.)
