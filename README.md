# Python Mini Projects 🚀

This repo is part of my AI/ML learning journey.

## 📅 Timeline:
**Start Date:** June 28, 2025  
**Goal:** Finish core Python projects by July 5, 2025  

## ✅ Project List:

1. ✅ Simple Calculator  
2. 🔨 Web Scraper (WIP)  
3. 🕹️ Basic Chatbot  
4. 📊 Data Visualizer  

Each project will have its own folder with:  
- Code  
- README (explaining what the project does)  

## ⚡ Why I'm Doing This:
Building up my coding logic, project workflow, and GitHub presence as I prepare for AI/ML internships.
